Yo, check this out!

I have a client with a standard list of steps taken to provide his services on his website. The original list was already pretty awesome. But this client has an eye for style and wanted to step it up. He describe changing the list into someting that looked like a coffee table book. The budget was pretty low (why are they always low lol) which left me with <strong>4 hours</strong> to style and program. With the help of jQuery I was able to installed some pretty smooth animations.

Enjoy!

PS - one this day I was having issues with my internet so loading jQuery with a CDN as difficult so I pasted it into a local file. Disregard and replace if your internet is stable.
